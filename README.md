## Greetings, fellow hackers! ðŸ¤“

My name is Thomas, and I'm a software engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My journey into the world of hacking began when I was a teenager and started tinkering with old computers (ZX81, and C64) in my spare time. Since then, I've made it my life's work to push the boundaries of what's possible with code.

Over the years, I've worked on various exciting projects, from developing complex web applications to hacking into cutting-edge technologies. My expertise lies in **Java**, **Digital Identity**, and **Software Architecture**, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges to keep my skills sharp.

As a hacker, the best way to learn is by doing. That's why I'm a big proponent of open-source software and the hacker ethic of sharing knowledge and collaborating. I've contributed to several open-source projects over the years and am always eager to help others learn and grow as hackers.

I'm a **[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) maintainer** and help the project by fixing bugs, implementing new features and building PoCs.

In my spare time I organize the [Java User Group Saarland](http://jugsaar.de/) and enjoy tinkering with JVMs, Compilers and the Cloud.

If you want to learn more about me or my work, please check out my GitHub repository or contact me directly. I'm always looking for new projects and collaborators and am excited to see what we can create together. Happy hacking!
